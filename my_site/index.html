<h1>A manifesto on our open mind</h1>
<h2>Marine Delgado and Louise Kepel</h2>
<p>We, student of the Escola Aberta, we are a week of interaction, we are the experiment and the incubator, we are The Fearless. Experience defines itself in time and space. Tomorrow we will no longer exist, but today we vow:</p>
<p>-To pursue kindness in jabbing,</p>
<p>-To cultivate a multidisciplinary approach, as in the form of a library, a flag, a recreated image or 500 sheets of paper.</p>
<p>-To confront creativity and provoke experimentation; we do like to smash things, destroy and try again, and we take our insanity very seriously.</p>
<p>-To revere flexibility, as responsibilities start in dreams.</p>
<p>-To favor collaboration; no Man is ever an island.</p>
<p>-To allow doubt.</p>
<p>Let’s feel right. Let’s give and take on challenges. Let’s take language to its limits. Let’s be bold and play the contradiction.</p>
<p>MANIFESTO DOES NOT EXPIRE TODAY</p>
